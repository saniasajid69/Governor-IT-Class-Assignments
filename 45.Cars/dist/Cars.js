//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function storeCarInfo(manufacture, modelName, ...extraOption) {
    const carInfo = Object.assign({ manufacture,
        modelName }, Object.assign({}, ...extraOption));
